- How will I implement the network model on landlab
- (bonus) Start coding
- meeting with Ricardo (9:30-3 except geohackeo)

7/5/2022
- multiple grain sizes bedload sediment transport on the literature.
- Read Czuba papers to understand what's implemented on landlab to 
able to compare it to my current approaches.

7/13/2022
-Check with Laurent about my landlab installation (Done)
-Wilcock & Crowe 2003
-take a look at "Simulated Dynamics of Mixed Versus Uniform Grain Size Sediment Pulses in a Gravel-Bedded River"
-sort of a description of what the sedimentnetworktransporter can do 
-see what kind of problems Czuba matlab code can do to understand with the landlab
-look at the Cascade and Czuba
	-what numerical experiments they do
	-what questions are they asking
	-what variables are they modeling (input/output?)
	-can these models operate in landlab
	-what are the timescales used (dt and total T)
