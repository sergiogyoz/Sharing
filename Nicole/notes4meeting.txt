* Do gravel bed river size distributions record channel
network structure?

- no net sediment deposition/accumulation (long term process on tectonically active landscape)
- Sternberg exponential model for particle size reduction with downstream transport
- applies to all sediment particles and depends (alpha) only on the lithology
- discontinuous from bedload to suspension at 2mm
-
