- Use a mapper to feed information into the network
- look for github issues to see if anyone has asked about mapping from raster model grid to the network model grid
- big things
	1. mapping from one to the other.
	2. make the component.
	3. presenting your interdiciplinary degree plan
- unit transport function

01/23/2023

- See compatibility with the Sklar and Dietrich model
- check out Data Record to keep track of parcels

03/27/2023
- write one paragraph about the next step for the ML Mississipi modelling.

	A network structure input model can be used to potentially increase the 
	effectiveness in ML methods estimation of hydraulic parameters across the
	landscape, along with a more complex and detailed network output. Allowing 
	the network information to feed into a ML algorithm should provide it with 
	(implicit) weather and seasonal changes when the appropiate	time scales 
	are used. This can be further improved by the use of process driven
	ML algorithms.

- How to make predictions using AI (how many stations? conditions for good prediction)
- Optimal conditions for waterlevel predictions along the Mississipi using ML

- Another one on the landlab component
- make a comment on the fields for network grid model

05/23/2023

- Make the doc test of the single grain size model
- Definition of the component being done
	+ Component runs the "one_step" function
	+ Component has the multiple grain sizes functionality
	+ Components have each their doc test and unit test
		- look at the \test\components folder in landlab for examples
- Download the template for submission of the paper on the journal and start filling in:
	+ any examples that I might use for analytical solutions
	+ the equations and models being used
	+ the reproducibility from the original papers

- less detail but no buffer timeline for commite/prospectus

1/10/2024
ERIC
- Fields are only fields if they are shared to other components
- Be careful when altering the reference to a grid_node_stuff as it might make it invisible to other components --> line 439 like self._grid.at_node["channel_slope”][:] = S
- Keep functions simple (for testing) 10 to 20 lines max
- Install pip install nox and use nox -s lint to run the linters
Nicole
- Look at GMD for "user manual" (Jupyter notebooks) for components (talk to Sam)
- Make the example from the topography instead of making it from a network directly
- add references to the three paragraphs
- send class plan

- Finish adding references to the corrected version and maybe review the writting for accesibility for everyone on the commite
- Finalized 3 paragrahs and class list including the one that I'll be taking
- Put the example from the AGU to the GMD user manual maybe use an example that doesn't take forever (closer to the final solution)
