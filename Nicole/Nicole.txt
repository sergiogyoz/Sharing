	-what are the timescales used (dt and total T) (Done: hours, days, months, years)

Nicole jobs

-Email Leonard setup meeting and sergio and postdoc


7/28/2022
-How mobile the grain sizes are (bimodal distribution of sediment [sandy and big] )
-Abrasion on the bed by these grain sizes (mostly gravel)
-Implement something that calculate the abrasion of the bed as a function of the grain size
-sediment parcels as the move and the ammount of work they do on the bed (*)

-3 papers, 2 on model from Leonard and one theory

9/2/2022

for downstream fining of sediment flux in mountain rivers. Earth Surface Processes and Landforms
- egholm email paper

9/9/2022

- Nicole's simplification of the the sklar

9/16/2022
- Nicole's paper
- Crosby (other paper on email)
- prepare for lanscape evolution model (what do I think of the simplification? should we use a regular grid or network?)
- basin size Puerto Rico (36km^2 sparce (10mt) () )

9/30/2022
- Read https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1029/2017JF004431
- and also https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1029/2006WR005035

10/14/2022
- How does solving for eta_a comes in for solving for E
- What function do they use for q_ac
- Read "The problem of predicting..." to understand grain size distribution from hillslopes to the stream
- keep in mind: what's the point of the paper?  

10/21/2022
- Hillslopes paper from last week. (Get it ready for Tingan 3 weeks)
- Start implementing 
- Get an idea on how to add the 9/30/2022 paper to the model.

11/04/2022
- think how to implement Saltation abrasion model
- look at Nicole's saltation abrasion for that
- look at the Gasparini 2007 (email)
- maybe also look at the Sklar model to see the simplifications and stuff

11/18/2022
- Look at the two network papers email
- How to apply the Czuba paper to update the nodes (and the slopes of the links)
- What equations can I use to transport sediment from the information coming at the link from up
stream and the hillslope sediment (see picture)

01/13/2023
- GrainSizeBedRockInciser
- Use a mapper to feed information into the network
- look for github issues to see if anyone has asked about mapping from raster model grid to the network model grid
- big things
	1. mapping from one to the other.
	2. make the component.
	3. presenting your interdiciplinary degree plan
- unit transport function

01/23/2023
- Apply Czuba network transport equation and bedrock incision in a landlab Network grid model
	- Start coding a component for that
	- See what fields do I need from the network and which from the raster
	- Check how deep can I use the Zhang model

01/30/2023
- See the implementation of the parcels in the NetworkSedimentTransporter
- Can I build the GSBRI component from this NST component?
- Backtrack on Zheng paper to Sklar 
- See compatibility with the Sklar and Dietrich model
- check out Data Record to keep track of parcels

03/27/2023
- write one paragraph about the next step for the ML Mississipi modelling.

	A network structure input model can be used to potentially increase the 
	effectiveness in ML methods estimation of hydraulic parameters across the
	landscape, along with a more complex and detailed network output. Allowing 
	the network information to feed into a ML algorithm should provide it with 
	(implicit) weather and seasonal changes when the appropiate	time scales 
	are used. This can be further improved by the use of process driven
	ML algorithms.

- How to make predictions using AI (how many stations? conditions for good prediction)
- Optimal conditions for waterlevel predictions along the Mississipi using ML

- Another one on the landlab component
- make a comment on the fields for network grid model

05/23/2023
- Use OverlandFlow paper as a model for what my component paper would be
- Make the doc test of the single grain size model
- Definition of the component being done
	+ Component runs the "one_step" function
	+ Component has the multiple grain sizes functionality
	+ Components have each their doc test and unit test
		- look at the \test\components folder in landlab for examples
- Download the template for submission of the paper on the journal and start filling in:
	+ any examples that I might use for analytical solutions
	+ the equations and models being used
	+ the reproducibility from the original papers
- Writting 

--/--/--
- did testing

06/06/2023
- Make one of the plots from the paper.
- Run the code from the github repo of the paper.
- Match parameters to reproduce the ouputs of the code.

06/15/2023
- Put axis labels on your plots
- make 5 point model
- make a flat model
- check boundary conditions
- equations on the latex thing

06/20/2023
- The boundary conditions function can default to the "copy" of the upstream end
- it can also (if time permits) implement the other ones (fix sediment out, fix elevation change, or fix depth (as in the paper))
- check that the transport 

7/20/2023
- Look at the AGU sessions
- Emails to sessions that could be good by monday
- When you don't know what to code type (paper)
- CODE!

8/18/2023
- Beignet plot of profiles and alluvium for group meeting
- work on the methods section in the overleaf doc

8/25/2023
- don't reproduce graphs from the code, rather the paper directly
- Particularly
	-Figure 8 (fraction and effective alluvium cover)
	-Figure 7 elevation of bedrock evolution
- FINISH the semester goals doc and send it to Nicole
