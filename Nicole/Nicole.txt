- How will I implement the network model on landlab
- (bonus) Start coding
- meeting with Ricardo (9:30-3 except geohackeo)

7/5/2022
- multiple grain sizes bedload sediment transport on the literature.
- Read Czuba papers to understand what's implemented on landlab to 
able to compare it to my current approaches.

7/13/2022
-Check with Laurent about my landlab installation (Done)
-Wilcock & Crowe 2003 (done)
-take a look at "Simulated Dynamics of Mixed Versus Uniform Grain Size Sediment Pulses in a Gravel-Bedded River"
-sort of a description of what the sedimentnetworktransporter can do (Done)
-see what kind of problems Czuba matlab code can do to understand with the landlab
-look at the Cascade and Czuba
	-what numerical experiments they do (Done)
	-what questions are they asking
	-what variables are they modeling (input/output?)  (Done)
	-can these models operate in landlab
	-what are the timescales used (dt and total T) (Done: hours, days, months, years)

Nicole jobs
-Email Allison and ask what's being done right now
-Email Leonard setup meeting and sergio and postdoc


7/28/2022
-How mobile the grain sizes are (bimodal distribution of sediment [sandy and big] )
-Abrasion on the bed by these grain sizes (mostly gravel)
-Implement something that calculate the abrasion of the bed as a function of the grain size
-sediment parcels as the move and the ammount of work they do on the bed (*)
-read bunch of papers

8/11/2022
-3 papers, 2 on model from Leonard and one theory

9/2/2022
- first at the top new email Sklar and Dietrich 2004
- Downvalley fining of hillslope sediment in an alpine catchment: implications 
for downstream fining of sediment flux in mountain rivers. Earth Surface Processes and Landforms
- egholm email paper

9/9/2022
- Finish Sklar 2004
- Finish Downvalley fining of hillslope sediment in an alpine catchment: implications for downstream fining of sediment flux in mountain rivers
- Nicole's simplification of the the sklar

9/16/2022
- Nicole's paper
- Crosby (other paper on email)
- prepare for lanscape evolution model (what do I think of the simplification? should we use a regular grid or network?)
- basin size Puerto Rico (36km^2 sparce (10mt) () )

9/30/2022
- Read https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1029/2017JF004431
- and also https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1029/2006WR005035

10/14/2022
- How does solving for eta_a comes in for solving for E
- What function do they use for q_ac
- Read "The problem of predicting..." to understand grain size distribution from hillslopes to the stream
- keep in mind: what's the point of the paper?  

10/21/2022
- Hillslopes paper from last week. (Get it ready for Tingan 3 weeks)
- Start implementing 
- Get an idea on how to add the 9/30/2022 paper to the model.

11/04/2022
- think how to implement Saltation abrasion model
- look at Nicole's saltation abrasion for that
- look at the Gasparini 2007 (email)
- maybe also look at the Sklar model to see the simplifications and stuff

11/18/2022
- Look at the two network papers email
- How to apply the Czuba paper to update the nodes (and the slopes of the links)
- What equations can I use to transport sediment from the information coming at the link from up
stream and the hillslope sediment (see picture)

01/13/2023
- GrainSizeBedRockInciser
- Use a mapper to feed information into the network
- look for github issues to see if anyone has asked about mapping from raster model grid to the network model grid
- big things
	1. mapping from one to the other.
	2. make the component.
	3. presenting your interdiciplinary degree plan
- unit transport function

01/23/2023
- Apply Czuba network transport equation and bedrock incision in a landlab Network grid model
	- Start coding a component for that
	- See what fields do I need from the network and which from the raster
	- Check how deep can I use the Zhang model

01/30/2023
- See the implementation of the parcels in the NetworkSedimentTransporter
- Can I build the GSBRI component from this NST component?
- Backtrack on Zheng paper to Sklar 
- See compatibility with the Sklar and Dietrich model
- check out Data Record to keep track of parcels
