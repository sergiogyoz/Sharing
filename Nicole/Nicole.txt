- How will I implement the network model on landlab
- (bonus) Start coding
- meeting with Ricardo (9:30-3 except geohackeo)

7/5/2022
- multiple grain sizes bedload sediment transport on the literature.
- Read Czuba papers to understand what's implemented on landlab to 
able to compare it to my current approaches.

7/13/2022
-Check with Laurent about my landlab installation (Done)
-Wilcock & Crowe 2003 (done)
-take a look at "Simulated Dynamics of Mixed Versus Uniform Grain Size Sediment Pulses in a Gravel-Bedded River"
-sort of a description of what the sedimentnetworktransporter can do (Done)
-see what kind of problems Czuba matlab code can do to understand with the landlab
-look at the Cascade and Czuba
	-what numerical experiments they do (Done)
	-what questions are they asking
	-what variables are they modeling (input/output?)  (Done)
	-can these models operate in landlab
	-what are the timescales used (dt and total T) (Done: hours, days, months, years)

Nicole jobs
-Email Allison and ask what's being done right now
-Email Leonard setup meeting and sergio and postdoc


7/28/2022
-How mobile the grain sizes are (bimodal distribution of sediment [sandy and big] )
-Abrasion on the bed by these grain sizes (mostly gravel)
-Implement something that calculate the abrasion of the bed as a function of the grain size
-sediment parcels as the move and the ammount of work they do on the bed (*)
-read bunch of papers

8/11/2022
-3 papers, 2 on model from Leonard and one theory

9/2/2022
- first at the top new email Sklar and Dietrich 2004

for downstream fining of sediment flux in mountain rivers. Earth Surface Processes and Landforms
- egholm email paper

9/9/2022
- Finish Sklar 2004
- Finish Downvalley fining of hillslope sediment in an alpine catchment: implications for downstream fining of sediment flux in mountain rivers
- Nicole's simplification of the the sklar
